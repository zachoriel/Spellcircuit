<b>Dear WotC reviewer(s),</b>

If you're here because of my job application — hi!

This project is a personal work-in-progress I'm actively developing. It reflects both my current skillset and my enthusiasm for system design and gameplay architecture in Unity. Feel free to poke around; I'm always improving things, so you may see a few messy edges.

Thanks for taking the time to explore my code!
